Life, the Universe, and Everything
----------------------------------

An `Atom`_ feed generator for Plone sites.

Atom is an XML-based document format that describes lists of related
information known as "feeds". Feeds are composed of a number of items, known
as "entries", each with an extensible set of attached metadata. For example,
each entry has a title.

The primary use case that Atom addresses is the syndication of Web content
such as weblogs and news headlines to Web sites as well as directly to user
agents.

Atom feeds have multiple `advantages`_ over RSS feeds.

Don't Panic

TBD.

Plone 4.3
^^^^^^^^^

Please note that starting Plone 4.3 `Atom is among the standard supported
syndication formats`_, so this package will not be needed.
