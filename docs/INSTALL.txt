Installation
------------

To enable this product in a buildout-based installation:

1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``collective.syndication`` to the list
   of eggs to install::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        collective.syndication

2. If you are using Plone 4.2 you may need to use plone.app.collection version
   1.0.6 or later::

    [versions]
    ...
    plone.app.collection = 1.0.6

After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will
take care of updating your system.

Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.

Check the box next to ``collective.syndication`` and click the 'Activate'
button.

Note: You may have to empty your browser cache and save your resource
registries in order to see the effects of the product installation.
